Cross 2 - Enemy movement and animation

For this update I created an enemy that would run toward the player and another enemy that would shoot toward the player. The enemy also has an animation for being hurt along with HP that when depleted the enemy will be destroyed.

The code is built so that when the player gets too close to the shooting enemy, the enemy will shoot a projectile in the direction they are facing hoping to damage the player. The rolling enemy will detect if the player is close enough to roll towards them and if they miss they will continue rolling. If an enemy is shot with the player's bullets, they will shine red. 

In the next update the player will be able to pause the game and it will display the player's life count along with a start screen.
